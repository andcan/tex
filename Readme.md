When users of our library land on our project page, we need to make sure we have the right things in our `README.md` so
that they can find what they need to know quickly. This might be your license or links to GoDoc and/or your testing page.
Even though we have [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/) for the programmer docs, it is not enough and is not necessarily aimed
at the same audience as the users who land here. This is especially true for people new to Go.
See the original blog post for why this project exists :
[Creating a Better ReadMe for GoLang Packages](https://chilts.org/2017/01/10/readme-minimum-info-needed-for-your-golang-library).
Use the online [GoReadMe generator](http://go-readme.golang.nz/).
